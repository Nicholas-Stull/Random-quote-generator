To turn your `random_quote_generator.py` module into a library that can be installed and used by other Python projects, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory to hold your library. For example, you might create a directory called `random_quote_library.`
2. Copy your `random_quote_generator.py file into this new directory.``
3. Create a new file in the `random_quote_library` directory called `setup.py.` This file will contain information about your library, such as its name, version, and dependencies. Here's an example of what this file might look like:

```python
# random_quote_library/setup.py

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='random_quote_generator',
    version='1.0.0',
    description='A library for generating random quotes',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'numpy>=1.18.5',
        'matplotlib>=3.2.2'
    ],
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
    python_requires='>=3.6',
)
```

In this example `setup.py`, we're using `setuptools` to package our library. We specify the name of the library, its version, a brief description, a list of dependencies, and other metadata that will be used when installing the library.
4. Create a `README.md` file in the `random_quote_library` directory to provide information about your library and how to use it.
5. (Optional) Create a `LICENSE` file in the `random_quote_library` directory to specify the terms of use for your library.
6. (Optional) Create a `requirements.txt` file in the `random_quote_library` directory to list the dependencies needed for your library.
7. (Optional) Create a `MANIFEST.in` file in the `random_quote_library` directory to specify which files should be included in the distribution.
8. (Optional) Create a `tests` directory in the `random_quote_library` directory to hold your library's tests.
9. (Optional) Write tests for your library to ensure that it functions correctly.
10. Build the library by running the following command in the `random_quote_library directory:`
	```python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel```
This will create a `dist` directory with the source distribution and wheel distribution of your library.
11. Upload your library to PyPI (the Python Package Index) so that others can easily install it. You can use the `twine` package to do this. First, install `twine` by running:
	```pip install twine```
	Then, upload your library by running:
	```twine upload dist/*```
You'll be prompted to enter your PyPI credentials (you'll need to create an account if you haven't already), and then `twine` will upload your library.
Alternatively, you can distribute your library as a source distribution or wheel file by sharing the file directly or hosting it on a repository like GitHub. Users can then install your library by downloading and installing the distribution file using `pip`.
That's it! Once you've uploaded your library to PyPI, others can install it by running:
```pip install random_quote_generator```
And then they can use your library in their Python projects by importing the get_random_quote function:
```python
from random_quote_generator import get_random_quote

quote = get_random_quote()
print(quote)
```
